# Colour Mixing and Systems
_18/03/2021_

## Additive colour systems
- RGB colour model
- When adding light rays together you only need Red Green and Blue to create any colour
- Black is absence of light
- White is a combination of all the colours

## Subtractive colour systems
- CMYK (Cyan Yellow Magenta and Black)
- Colours are absorbed into the object
- These reflect the colours you end up seeing
    - Magenta reflects red and blue so green is absorbed
    - Yellow reflects red and green so blue is absorbed
- You CMY to create all possible colours
    - E.g mixing cyan and yellow will absorb both red and blue and reflect only the green colour
- Mixing all colours creates a muddy colour
- K (black) is added to shade or create black
