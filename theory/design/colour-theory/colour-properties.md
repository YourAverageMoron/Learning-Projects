# Colour Properties
_18/03/2021_

## Hue
- It is what we call a colour
- The reflected light wave that we see in our eye
- A colour with no values added to it
- It is the colour in its purest form with no whites, blacks or greys added to it

## Saturation
- The intensity of a colour
- How well a colour is reflected back to us
- Fully saturated colours will show the purest form of its hue
- Fully unsaturated colours will have grey tones and won't show the colour of the hue

---

## Value
- The lightness and darkness of a colour
- In painting this is controlled by the number of whites, blacks or greys in a colour
- When white is added to a colour it is called a **TINT** of the colour
- When black is added to a colour it is called a **SHADE* of the colour
- When greys are added to a colour it is called a **TONE** of the colour
- **TONAL RANGE** of a colour describes the range of greys from black to white added to the colour

## Lightness
- How light or dark the colour is compared to other light objects

---

## Brightness
- How much light the actual colour is emitting
- If a colour has a high brightness it will emit a higher concentration of light
- Low brightness colours will be darker in nature as it will emit less light

---

## Colour models
- HSV (Hue Saturation Value)
- HSL (Hue Saturation Lightness)
- HSB (Hue Saturation Brightness)

---

## Contrast
- The difference in hues, saturation, and values (or brightness or lightness)
- Colours with a high contrast property means that one or more of HSV properties are far apart from each other
- Providing high contrast in a design can help elements stand out
- **Contrast trick when designing**
    - Turn the design into a greyscale image
    - If you can still see everything clearly the contrast is high enough
    - If elements become illegible then the contrast is too low
